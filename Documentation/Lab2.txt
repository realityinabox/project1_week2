Module "PDC1"      (component PDC8544)
   - PDC1_GetWidth -Returns the width of the display in pixels
   - PDC1_GetHeight -Returns the height of the display in pixels
   - PDC1_GetLongerSide -Returns the longer side of the display in pixels
   - PDC1_GetShorterSide -Returns the shorter side of the display in pixels
   - PDC1_SetDisplayOrientation -Sets current display orientation
   - PDC1_GetDisplayOrientation -Returns the current display orientation
   - PDC1_SetPos -Sets the cursor to the given position
   - PDC1_Clear -Clears the whole display memory.
   - PDC1_ClearLine -Clears a character line on the display
   - PDC1_WriteChar -Writes a single character to the display at the current position.
   - PDC1_WriteString -Writes a zero byte terminated string to the display at the current cursor position.
   - PDC1_WriteLineStr -Writes a string to the given line position.
   - PDC1_SetContrast -Sets the display contrast.
   - PDC1_SetMode -Sets the mode of the display (if inverted or not).
   - PDC1_UpdateFull -Updates the whole display
   - PDC1_UpdateRegion -Updates a region of the display
   - PDC1_GetLCD -Method to be called for mutual exclusive access to the LCD
   - PDC1_GiveLCD -Method to be called for mutual exclusive access to the LCD
   - PDC1_Init -Display driver initialization
   - PDC1_Deinit -Module Deinitialization

Module "WAIT1"     (component Wait)
   - WAIT1_Wait10Cycles -Wait for 10 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_Wait100Cycles -Wait for 100 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_WaitCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (16bit data type).
   - WAIT1_WaitLongCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (32bit data type).
   - WAIT1_Waitms -Wait for a specified time in milliseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitus -Wait for a specified time in microseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.

Module "SM1"       (component SPIMaster_LDD)
   - SM1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SM1_SendBlock -This method sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission 
                is not completed. The method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation.
   - SM1_ReceiveBlock -This method specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified 
                number of characters is received. The method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive 
                operation.

Module "Cpu"       (component MK64FN1M0LQ12)
